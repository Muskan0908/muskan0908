### " It's harder to read a code than to write it."-Joel Spolsky

Something about me:

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development using React JS.
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m skilled in Java,Python and C.
- ğŸ‘¯ I care about building projects that help people and make a difference in the real world.
- ğŸ¤” I believe sometimes it pays to stay in bed on Monday, rather than spending the rest of the week debugging Monday's  code.
